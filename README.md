It's a Connect 4 Game using Java,

Connect 4 is a turn based 2 player game played on a 6 rows by 7 columns board. Each player 
on his turn chooses a column to put a piece at. A piece played in a column falls till it reaches 
the bottom of the column, or it gets stacked above another piece. The winner is the player
